# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


This Jupyter Notebook aims to explore and compare different machine learning models for the detection of fraudulent transactions in credit cards. Utilizing a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, including features such as time, transaction amounts, and labels indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or not, the notebook covers the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify possible class imbalances, and comprehend the nature of the data.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing data, and other preprocessing steps to prepare the data for model training.

Model Training: Implementation and training of different fraud detection models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as AUC-ROC, precision, recall, F1-Score, and visualizing ROC curves and confusion matrices.

Choosing the Best Model: Identifying the model that best suits the specific credit card fraud detection problem based on evaluation metrics.
